# Spending-of-a-Turkish-Student

I decided to choose a claim as the following (notice that I study and live in Turkey):  
**Null Hypothesis (H₀):
As a student at Sabancı University, in high-inflation conditions, there is no significant shift in my spending habits from discretionary to essential categories.** 

**Alternative Hypothesis (H₁):
As a student at Sabancı University, in high-inflation conditions, there is a significant shift in my spending habits from discretionary to essential categories.**

## Final Report

## Questions to Address
- **Does the official inflation rate reflect an increase in the volume of spending?**
  - Compare the spending volumes with inflation rates for the same months.
  - Analyze the change in spending volume over the term.
- **Is there a shift in the type of the favorite discretionary purchase?**
- **Has the share of discretionary purchases over the total daily / weekly spending decreased?**
- **Which days are more suitable for discretionary spending?**

### Analysis Focus
- Weekly/monthly spending trends and the share of both discretionary and essential categories are shown.
- The main sources of income are identified and it is analyzed whether they mitigate the effects of inflation:
  - Limited income
  - Reliance on allowances

### Key Insights
- Discretionary spending is more elastic to economic pressures, especially in a high-inflation environment.
- Analyze whether the main sources of income provide enough financial stability for a student under inflationary pressures.

## ML Modeling
- **Objective:** Based on the spending and income parameters, the decision is made for discretionary spending.
